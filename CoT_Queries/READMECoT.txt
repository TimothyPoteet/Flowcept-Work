This folder is organized by how the Chain-of-Thought Queries are laid out.

CoT-WIK-WCON-ROLE VS CoT-NA-NA-NA 
- The first one is the FULL CONTEXT version of Chain-of-Thought Queries. Meaning it has access to WIK, WCON, and Role. 
- Whereas the other is just a Chain-of-Thought Query, and it just has the query, and enough context to make it be considered Chain-of-Thought such as the reasoning steps.
